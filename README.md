## Description ##
This repository contains assignments and project submitted to DAA course offered in Fall 2020 at PafKiet.
Backtracking alogrithm is a procedure which is utilized to recursively take care of issues by endeavoring to develop an answer logically, each part in turn, and clearing arrangement that doesn't prevail to fulfill the restrictions of the issue anytime of time. 

Utilizing Backtracking calculation to orchestrate N sovereigns on NxN chessboard is one most basic occurrences. In this issue the N sovereigns are to be set on a chessboard such that no sovereign is assaulting other sovereign. Prior to going further we should figure out how sovereign assault. The sovereign in chess assault in vertical, even and corner to corner way. In the begining we place first sovereign arbitrarily and afterward we place the following sovereign in any of the accessible safe spots (place that are not in assault with first sovereign). We repeatdly play out this cycle until all unplaced sovereigns comes to 0 or if there is no spot left which is protected. In the event that if there is no spot left for outstanding sovereign we change the situation of last sovereign that was put. We need to continue with this cycle and in the end we get the ideal arrangement. 

The benefit of Backtracking calculation is it is moderately simpler to code and utilize less lines of code. It works bit by bit speaking to the answer for the necessary issue which is extremely straightforward decipher.
